## Skills and Experience Gained

### Fundamentals of Finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs)

- 📘 **Learned Fundamentals of Finetuning LLMs**: Acquired a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of finetuning a Large Language Model (LLM).

### Understanding Finetuning vs. Prompt Engineering

- 🤔 **Distinguished Between Finetuning and Prompt Engineering**: Gained clarity on how finetuning differs from prompt engineering and learned when to effectively use both techniques.

### Practical Experience with Real Data Sets

- 💡 **Gained Practical Experience with Real Data Sets**: Obtained hands-on experience with real data sets and mastered techniques to apply these skills to my own projects.

## Key Learnings from the "Finetuning Large Language Models" Course

### Course Introduction

In the "Finetuning Large Language Models" course, I had the opportunity to learn from Sharon Zhou, Co-Founder and CEO of Lamini, and an instructor for the GANs Specialization and How Diffusion Models Work.

### Skills Acquired

- 🧠 **Understanding When to Apply Finetuning on LLMs**: Gained a thorough understanding of when to apply finetuning to Large Language Models.

- 💾 **Data Preparation for Finetuning**: Learned how to prepare my data effectively for finetuning processes.

- 🤖 **Training and Evaluating an LLM on Custom Data**: Acquired the skills to train and evaluate a Large Language Model on my own data.

### Finetuning Insights

- 🛠️ **Practical Application of Finetuning**: Through finetuning, I learned to take my own data to train the model on it, and update the weights of the neural nets in the LLM. This process changes the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation. Finetuning enables the model to learn style, form, and incorporate new knowledge to improve results.
